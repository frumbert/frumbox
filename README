Frumbox - yet another jquery lightbox plugin.

The purpose of this plugin is to to proved an animated opening, easy to use lightbox designed with iframes in mind - both popping up from within an iframe, and to display iframes in the popup.

It does not work with images, ajax-fed data, do slideshows, have fancy opening effects, or anything like that. If you want that sort of functionality then you should look at http://floatboxjs.com/ or http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/. It does not offer a great deal of events, or options.

It does work with iframes. It opens from within an iframe in the parent (or self), and will display an iframe. It is designed to work on IE7+, Firefox, Chrome/Safari and iOS 5+ (though it might also work on iOS 4).

Features:

  - Will open an iframe based on the href of the opening object
  - Optionally can specify a href to open if triggering directly
  - Has onAfterOpen and onAfterClose event hooks
  - Can specify whether it closes on pressing the Escape key, clicking on the overlay background, or whether the close button is visible
  - Uses a CSS3 based shadow effect, and detects is CSS3PIE (window.PIE) javascript is available to call after opening to support box shadows, rounded edges etc in IE6-9
  - Animates from the opening element to the final position
  - Defaults to centered on screen
  - Able to specify the top, left, width and height of the final position (e.g. it doesn't have to be centered)
