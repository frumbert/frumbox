Frumbox - yet another jquery lightbox plugin - except for IFRAMES.
------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this plugin is to to proved an animated opening, easy to use lightbox designed with iframes in mind - both popping up from within an iframe, and to display iframes in the popup.
It does NOT do images, ajax-fed data, slideshows, next/back, title overlays, have fancy opening effects, or anything like that. If you want that sort of functionality then you should look at http://floatboxjs.com/ or http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/.
It DOES work with iframes. It opens from within an iframe in the parent (or self), and will display an iframe. It is designed to work on IE7+, Firefox, Chrome/Safari and iOS 5+ (though it might also work on iOS 4).

Features:

  - Will open an iframe based on the href attribute of the opening object
  - Optionally can specify the URI to open if triggering directly (e.g. from button, div, etc)
  - Has onAfterOpen and onAfterClose event hooks so you know when it has been opened or closed
  - Public open, close and setSize methods to control programatically
  - Can specify whether it closes on pressing the Escape key, clicking on the overlay background, or whether the close button is visible
  - Uses a CSS3 based shadow effect, and detects CSS3PIE (window.PIE) javascript is available to call after opening to support box shadows, rounded edges etc in IE6-9
  - Animates from the opening element to the final position (and back again on close; variable speed)
  - Defaults to centered on screen
  - Able to specify the top, left, width and height of the final position (e.g. it doesn't have to be centered)
  - Is able to be triggered in the PARENT frame (e.g. useful from within iframes in the same domain)
